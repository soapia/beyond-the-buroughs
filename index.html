    i'm named after three people. my first name is from my great aunt sophie on my fathers side (i never met her, but i hear she was just as rambunctious as i am), but my dad changed the "ph" to an "f" to africanize the name. my middle name is partially after my mother, and partially just tooro custom: in her tribe, children are assigned empaakos (aka, pet names) at birth, and because she was the second born, hers was amooti, so she decided to make that my middle name as well (my father just misspelled it on the birth certificate, lol). lastly, my last name is from my father, and while in the united states last names are just from your father, it works a bit differently in luo land back in kenya. in his tribe, children are assigned a last name, ongele meaning "one who likes to crawl". my people are pretty cool, right?

    about me
  </p>
  <div class='content'>
    i like to call myself a hacktivist. that's not to say that i spend my free time hacking it up with anonymous, but rather that my passions are at the intersection of computing and social justice. outside of my hack-y endeavors, i love to bake (bonus points for gluten-free / vegan recipes!), spend time with my friends and family, scroll aimlessly on tiktok (and make some videos myself), zillow surf for dream city apartments.
